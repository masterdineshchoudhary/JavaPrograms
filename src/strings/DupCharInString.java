// Find duplicate chars and their count in given string
/*
 * LOGIC:
 * We use HashMap and Set to find the duplicate characters in a string. 
 * First, we convert the given string to char array. 
 * We then create one HashMap with Character as a key and itâ€™s number of occurrences as a value. 
 * Then we extract a Set containing all keys of this HashMap using keySet() method. 
 * Then we use this keySet to get the duplicate characters i.e characters which have appeared more than once in the given string.
